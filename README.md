## My process

### 09/11

- Set up files (js, css, html)
- Fetch the data from the API and render it in the console for now.
- Build up the basic structure of the page in HTML.
- Set up colour variables in CSS
- Render the quote on the page
- Hook up the button to make a new API call on button click

### 10/11

- Continuing with styling
- Working out how to render different images based on the screen sizes
- Checking responsiveness of app as I made it for mobile-first
- Adding hover states (which I definitely nearly forgot...)

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

## What I learned

Few things to take away from this mini-project:

- Rendering different images based on screen size using Vanilla JS
- Recap on fetching from API
- Flexbox recap - felt more confident aligning content on the page
- Hover states on buttons
- Positioning divs on top of other divs
